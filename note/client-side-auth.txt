There are some steps:
1. Create api/auth folder, then [...nextauth].js in this folder

2. Import "import { Provider } from 'next-auth/client'"
    Then: wrap in _app.js:
        <Provider>
            {children}
        </Provider>
        
    Purpose this step:
        1. Problem: each page in folder pages, session just runs one time, and not return final result (just call one time)
        2. When add this: can runs and return the result as expected

    Note: all files in components folder can work well without config this

3.  Use useSession, getSession for protect router, authentication all app (refer dashboard, navbar component)
